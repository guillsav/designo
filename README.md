# Designo

Designo is a project comming from the list of front-end challenges on Front-end Mentors.
To complete this project I've decided to use the Tailwindcss framework to have a better understanding on our to use the framework in a project. 
All assets like svg icons, mockups, and images where provided in by Front-end Mentors. The project focuses only on the front-end so no apis call or backend project to serve data.

## How to run the app

1. Either fork or download the app and open the folder in the terminal.
2. Install all dependencies using the `yarn install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `yarn start` local command. The app will be served at http://localhost:3000/
4. Go to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser and start searching for movies.
