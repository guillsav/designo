# Designo
Designo is a project coming from the list of front-end challenges on Front-end Mentors. To complete this project I've decided to use the Tailwindcss framework. All assets like SVG icons, mockups, and images were provided by Front-end Mentors. The project focuses only on the front-end no APIs call or backend project to serve data.

## How to run the app

1. Either fork or download the app and open the folder in the terminal.
2. Install all dependencies using the `yarn install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `yarn start` local command. The app will be served at http://localhost:3000
4. Go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser and start searching for movies.
